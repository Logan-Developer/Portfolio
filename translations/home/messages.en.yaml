    title: Who am i?
    text: I am Logan Humbert, apprentice in the french Btech IT Services to Organisations (SIO), and in the french company SkinSoft. I am passionated by IT development in it's
      different forms. I like to make websites, mobile and desktop applications, and I really want to pursue this way to become an IT developer.
      During my free time, i create different programms and i try to learn by myself new things.  For example, i am currently trying to learn the test driven development, wich is
      for me a very efficient method of coding.
      On top of that, i am very autonomous, reliable, and i am capable of returning all tasks entrusted to me, in time and respecting all expectations.
      My professors were able to see that multiple times, especially during the lockdown due to the sanitary crisis.
      I think that all these qualities will be real assets for my professional career.
